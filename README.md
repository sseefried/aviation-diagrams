Input data

- Track
- TAS (from 100 to 1000 knots)
- Wind velocity (0 - 200 knots)
- Wind direction (0 to 360)

All inputs are whole numbers

Output data:
- drift angle
- heading
- ground speed

In aviation they always input wind as 100 knots from 270 rather than
100 knots towards 090 (i.e. 100 knots from the west)

- 360 is north
- 090 is east
- 180 is south
- 270 is west

Also would be nice to have crosswind and head or tail wind components given.
That's how they do it on their wiz wheel.

Heading = Track +- Drift
