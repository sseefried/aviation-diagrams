TODO

- label arrows nicely.
- always show tailwind
- make the inputs responsive too. Must look good on phones
- Solve the text size problem. My thought is that we must draw the
  diagram without the text, find that bounding box and then use that as a
  scale factor. It's awful I know.
- Put text on outside of line sometimes.
